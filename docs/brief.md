# Project Brief: oFraud Web Admin Dashboard

## Executive Summary

The oFraud Web Admin Dashboard is a comprehensive web-based administrative platform designed to manage the oFraud cybercrime reporting ecosystem. This dashboard empowers administrators to oversee user accounts, moderate and evaluate cybercrime incident reports, manage cybercrime categories, and monitor system-wide activity through an intuitive interface built with Next.js and shadcn/ui components.

The platform addresses the critical need for efficient administration of a growing database of cybercrime incidents reported by end-users through the existing oFraud mobile application. By providing administrators with powerful tools for incident evaluation, user management, and category administration, the dashboard ensures data quality, appropriate incident handling, and effective community protection against cyber threats.

**Target Market:** Internal administrative staff and cybersecurity professionals managing the oFraud platform
**Key Value Proposition:** Centralized, efficient administration of cybercrime reports with real-time oversight, evaluation workflows, and comprehensive user management capabilities

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

The oFraud mobile application currently allows end-users to report cybercrime incidents, but there is **no efficient web-based administrative interface** for managing these reports and users at scale. Current challenges include:

- **No centralized incident moderation system** - Administrators lack a structured workflow to review, approve, or reject incident reports
- **Limited user oversight** - No comprehensive view of registered users, their activity, or ability to manage user accounts efficiently
- **Manual category management** - Cybercrime categories require manual database updates rather than a user-friendly interface
- **Lack of visibility into incident status** - No dashboard to monitor pending, approved, or rejected incidents
- **Inefficient supervisor assignment** - No streamlined process to assign supervisors to evaluate specific incidents

### Impact of the Problem

Without an administrative dashboard:
- **Response time suffers** - Manual processes delay incident evaluation and user support
- **Data quality degrades** - Inconsistent evaluation criteria without standardized workflows
- **Scalability limitations** - Current approach cannot handle growing incident volumes
- **Administrative burden increases** - Staff spend excessive time on repetitive tasks
- **Security risks** - Delayed identification of malicious or spam reports

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

While the backend API provides endpoints for administration (`/admin/*` routes), there is **no user interface** to leverage these capabilities. Administrators would need to:
- Use API testing tools (Postman, cURL) for every operation
- Write custom scripts for routine tasks
- Lack visual context for decision-making (no preview of evidence, user history, etc.)

### Urgency and Importance

With the mobile application already deployed and user-generated content accumulating, the need for administrative oversight is **immediate and critical**. Every day without proper moderation tools:
- Increases the backlog of unreviewed incidents
- Exposes users to potentially misleading or malicious content
- Undermines trust in the platform's credibility
- Creates legal and compliance risks for the organization

---

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept and Approach

The oFraud Web Admin Dashboard is a **Next.js-based web application** that provides a comprehensive administrative interface for the oFraud ecosystem. The solution features:

- **Intuitive admin authentication system** with role-based access (admins vs. regular users)
- **Incident management workspace** with filtering, search, detailed views, and status evaluation
- **User administration panel** for viewing, editing, activating/deactivating user accounts
- **Category management interface** for CRUD operations on cybercrime categories
- **Dashboard analytics** displaying key metrics and incident statistics

### Key Differentiators

1. **Built on existing infrastructure** - Leverages the existing NestJS backend API without requiring backend refactoring
2. **Modern, responsive design** - shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS ensure a polished, accessible interface
3. **Role-aware authentication** - Distinguishes between admin and regular users using the existing `is_admin` flag
4. **Comprehensive incident context** - Displays full incident details including evidence, user information, and evaluation history
5. **Real-time status management** - Enables instant incident approval/rejection with supervisor assignment

### Why This Solution Will Succeed

- **Technical alignment** - Uses the same tech stack philosophy (TypeScript, modern frameworks) as the mobile app
- **API-first design** - All functionality is backed by existing, tested API endpoints
- **Progressive enhancement** - Can be deployed incrementally, starting with most critical features
- **Maintainability** - Component-based architecture with shadcn/ui ensures consistency and ease of updates

### High-Level Vision

The dashboard will serve as the **central command center** for oFraud administrators, providing:
- Real-time visibility into platform health and activity
- Streamlined workflows that reduce administrative overhead by 70%
- Data-driven insights for improving incident categorization and prevention strategies
- Foundation for future advanced features (ML-assisted categorization, automated spam detection, etc.)

```

**Service Architecture:**
- **Monorepo approach** - Frontend and backend in same repository for coordinated development
- **Clear API boundaries** - Frontend communicates exclusively via REST API (no direct database access)
- **Authentication flow** - JWT tokens stored in httpOnly cookies or localStorage with refresh token mechanism
- **Error handling** - Centralized error boundary components, user-friendly error messages

**Integration Requirements:**
- **Existing API endpoints** - Use all `/admin/*`, `/categories/*`, `/incidents/*` routes without modification
- **File uploads** - Integrate with `/files/upload` endpoint for category images
- **CORS configuration** - Backend must allow frontend domain (e.g., `dashboard.ofraud.com`)

**Security/Compliance:**
- **Authentication required** - All admin routes protected by JWT verification
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** - Check `is_admin` flag on all admin endpoints
- **Input validation** - Client-side (React Hook Form + Zod) and server-side (NestJS DTOs)
- **SQL injection prevention** - Use parameterized queries (already implemented in backend)
- **XSS protection** - Sanitize user-generated content before rendering
- **HTTPS only** - Enforce secure connections in production
- **Rate limiting** - Backend should implement rate limiting on auth endpoints (future enhancement)
- **Data privacy** - Handle PII (emails, names) according to data protection regulations

---

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

**Budget:**
- Development resources: Small team (1-2 frontend developers + 1 designer/QA)
- Hosting costs: Minimal incremental cost (Vercel free tier or <$50/month)
- No budget for third-party SaaS integrations (analytics, monitoring beyond free tiers)

**Timeline:**
- **MVP delivery target: 8 weeks** from kickoff
- Week 1-2: Setup, authentication, basic layout
- Week 3-4: Incident management features
- Week 5-6: User and category management
- Week 7: Testing, bug fixes, polish
- Week 8: Deployment, documentation, handoff

**Resources:**
- Backend API is **feature-complete** for MVP needs (no backend development required)
- Design system (shadcn/ui) provides 80% of needed components out-of-box
- Database schema is **fixed** (cannot modify tables for MVP)
- Existing mobile app users **not impacted** by admin dashboard development

**Technical:**
- Must work with **existing MySQL schema** without migrations
- Backend API endpoints **cannot be modified** (treat as external service)
- Frontend must handle backend errors gracefully (API may return Spanish error messages)
- Limited backend support for advanced features (e.g., no WebSocket for real-time updates)
- `is_admin` flag is **boolean** (no granular roles like "moderator" vs "super admin" in MVP)

### Key Assumptions

- **Assumption 1:** Administrators have reliable internet connectivity (minimum 10 Mbps) and modern browsers
- **Assumption 2:** Backend API is stable and available 99%+ of the time during MVP development
- **Assumption 3:** Admin users are trusted; no need for complex approval workflows for admin actions
- **Assumption 4:** Spanish language is sufficient for MVP (all admin users are Spanish-speaking)
- **Assumption 5:** Existing JWT authentication system is secure and production-ready
- **Assumption 6:** Database performance is adequate for expected query load (<500 concurrent incidents, <100 categories, <10,000 users initially)
- **Assumption 7:** Evidence images are hosted externally (URLs stored in `evidencia` table) and accessible
- **Assumption 8:** Admin users will be trained on the system (no in-app tutorials required for MVP)
- **Assumption 9:** Incident evaluation is a manual process (no automated approval criteria for MVP)
- **Assumption 10:** Desktop/laptop is primary admin device (mobile responsiveness is nice-to-have)

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Risk 1: Backend API instability** - If existing API has undiscovered bugs or performance issues, frontend development will be blocked. *Mitigation:* Conduct API testing sprint in Week 1, identify issues early.

- **Risk 2: Database performance degradation** - As incident volume grows, unoptimized queries (e.g., full-text search without indexing) may cause slow load times. *Mitigation:* Work with backend team to add indexes on `incidente.titulo`, `incidente.descripcion`, `usuario.email`.

- **Risk 3: Scope creep** - Stakeholders may request "just one more feature" that delays MVP. *Mitigation:* Strict MVP scope enforcement, maintain "Phase 2" backlog for all enhancement requests.

- **Risk 4: Design inconsistency** - Without dedicated designer, UI may feel inconsistent or unprofessional. *Mitigation:* Use shadcn/ui component library extensively, create simple design system documentation.

- **Risk 5: Authentication vulnerabilities** - Improper JWT handling could expose admin accounts to hijacking. *Mitigation:* Security review of auth implementation, use httpOnly cookies for token storage, implement token refresh mechanism.

- **Risk 6: Mobile app impact** - Changes to shared backend resources (e.g., category updates) might inadvertently break mobile app. *Mitigation:* Coordinate with mobile team, test API changes in staging environment before production.

### Open Questions

- **Q1:** What is the exact authentication flow for admins? Do they use the same `/auth/login` endpoint with `is_admin` check, or separate admin login?
- **Q2:** Are there existing admin user accounts in the database, or will the first admin be manually inserted via SQL?
- **Q3:** What is the desired pagination strategy for incident lists? (e.g., 20, 50, 100 items per page?)
- **Q4:** Should category images be mandatory or optional? What file size/format restrictions?
- **Q5:** When an admin inactivates a user, should that cascade to hide their incidents or just prevent login?
- **Q6:** What should happen to incidents when their category is deleted? (Prevent deletion if incidents exist, or orphan them?)
- **Q7:** Is there a staging/testing environment for the backend API, or only production?
- **Q8:** Who has authority to approve/reject incidents - all admins equally, or only those assigned as supervisors?
- **Q9:** What are the expected incident volumes? (e.g., 10/day, 100/day, 1000/day?)
- **Q10:** Are there any legal/compliance requirements for data retention, audit logs, or user privacy?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- **User Experience Research:** Conduct 2-3 admin user interviews to validate workflow assumptions and identify pain points in current processes
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Test backend API under load (e.g., 1000 incidents in database) to identify query optimization needs
- **Security Audit:** Review existing backend authentication, authorization, and data validation for vulnerabilities
- **Competitor Analysis:** Evaluate similar admin dashboards (e.g., content moderation tools, support ticket systems) for UI/UX best practices
- **Database Indexing Strategy:** Analyze most common queries and add appropriate indexes to `incidente`, `usuario`, `categoria` tables
- **Error Handling Standards:** Document all possible API error responses and define user-friendly messaging strategy
- **Accessibility Compliance:** Determine if WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is required (likely yes for government/educational institutions)

## Appendices

### A. Research Summary

**Database Schema Analysis:**
- **7 core tables:** `usuario`, `incidente`, `categoria`, `estatus`, `riesgo`, `evidencia`
- **Key relationships:** Incidents link to users (reporter), categories, supervisors (also users), and status
- **Admin identification:** `is_admin` boolean flag on `usuario` table
- **User status:** `is_active` boolean flag for account activation/deactivation
- **Incident workflow:** Status IDs (1=Pending, 2=Approved, 3=Rejected) managed via `estatus` table
- **Evidence storage:** Separate `evidencia` table with URLs (implies external file hosting)

**Backend API Capabilities:**
- **Admin endpoints:** User listing, user CRUD, incident listing (all/approved/pending/rejected), incident evaluation, user inactivation
- **Category endpoints:** Full CRUD, filtering by risk level, statistics
- **Incident endpoints:** Create, read, update, soft delete (status change)
