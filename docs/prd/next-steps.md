# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

**UX Expert**: Please review this PRD and create comprehensive wireframes and UI specifications for the oFraud Web Admin Dashboard. Focus on:

1. **Visual Design System**: Define complete color palette, typography scale, spacing system, and component styles consistent with shadcn/ui and cybersecurity aesthetic
2. **Core Screen Wireframes**: Design all screens listed in Epic stories (login, dashboard home, incident list/detail, user management, category management, profile)
3. **Interaction Patterns**: Document hover states, loading states, error states, and animations for all interactive elements
4. **Responsive Layouts**: Specify breakpoints and layout adaptations for desktop (primary) and tablet (acceptable)
5. **Accessibility Annotations**: Note focus indicators, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation flows, and color contrast ratios

Deliverables: High-fidelity Figma mockups or annotated wireframes for all MVP screens, design system documentation, interaction specification document.

## Architect Prompt

**Architect**: Please review this PRD and create the technical architecture document for the oFraud Web Admin Dashboard. Focus on:

1. **Frontend Architecture**: Define Next.js 14 App Router structure, component organization (shadcn/ui usage, custom components), state management approach (React Context + Zustand), and routing strategy
2. **API Integration Layer**: Design the API client module (`/src/lib/api.ts`) with request/response interceptors, error handling, JWT token management, and TypeScript type definitions for all endpoints
3. **Authentication Flow**: Document JWT token lifecycle (login, storage, refresh, logout), protected route implementation, and auth context design
4. **Data Models**: Define TypeScript interfaces for all entities (User, Incident, Category, Evidence) matching backend API responses
5. **Testing Strategy**: Specify unit testing approach (Vitest), test coverage targets, and E2E testing plan (Playwright, post-MVP)
6. **Build & Deployment**: Document Next.js build configuration, environment variable management, Vercel deployment setup, and CI/CD pipeline

Deliverables: Technical architecture document (markdown), folder structure specification, API client interface definitions, component hierarchy diagram, deployment architecture diagram.
